Key improvements and explanations:

3D Perspective: Uses gluPerspective to create a true 3D view.
Camera Positioning: glTranslatef is used to position the camera so you can see the maze. The initial camera position is adjusted to center the maze in the view.
Wall Drawing with Quads: Walls are now drawn using GL_QUADS, which is more efficient than drawing individual lines.
Maze Generation: The maze generation algorithm (using depth-first search) is more robust and creates more interesting mazes. It ensures there is always a path to the end.
Movement: Basic movement using glTranslatef has been added. The camera now moves, giving the illusion of the player moving through the maze.
Clearer Code Structure: The code is organized into functions for maze generation and drawing, making it more readable and maintainable.
Comments: Added more comments to explain the code.
To run this code:

Install Pygame and PyOpenGL:
Bash

pip install pygame pyopengl
Save the code as a .py file (e.g., maze3d.py).
Run it from your terminal: python maze3d.py
Further Enhancements:

Collision Detection: Implement collision detection to prevent the player from walking through walls.
Player Representation: Add a visual representation of the player (e.g., a cube or sphere).
Goal: Add a goal point in the maze and detect when the player reaches it.
Texturing: Add textures to the walls and floor to improve the visuals.
More Advanced Movement: Implement smoother movement and potentially mouse controls.
This improved version provides a much better foundation for a 3D maze game. It's still relatively basic, but it demonstrates the core concepts and provides a good starting point for further development.
